This chapter describes OCamlBrowser, a source and compiled interface
browser, written using LablTk. This is a useful companion to the
programmer.

Its functions are:
\begin{itemize}
\item navigation through OCaml's modules (using compiled interfaces).
\item source editing, type-checking, and browsing.
\item integrated OCaml shell, running as a subprocess.
\end{itemize}

\section{Invocation} \label{s:browser-options}

The browser is started by the command "ocamlbrowser", as follows:
\begin{alltt}
        ocamlbrowser \var{options}
\end{alltt}

The following command-line options are recognized by "ocamlbrowser".

\begin{options}

\item["-I" \var{directory}]
Add the given directory to the list of directories searched for
source and compiled files. By default, only the standard library
directory is searched.  The standard library can also be changed by
setting the "OCAMLLIB" environment variable.

\item["-nolabels"]
Ignore non-optional labels in types. Labels cannot be used in
applications, and parameter order becomes strict.

\item["-oldui"]
Old multi-window interface. The default is now more like Smalltalk's
class browser.

\item["-rectypes"]
Allow arbitrary recursive types during type-checking.  By default,
only recursive types where the recursion goes through an object type
are supported.

\item["-version"]
Print version string and exit.

\item["-vnum"]
Print short version number and exit.

\item["-w" \var{warning-list}]
Enable or disable warnings according to the argument \var{warning-list}.

\end{options}

Most options can also be modified inside the application by the {\bf
  Modules - Path editor} and {\bf Compiler - Preferences} commands.
They are inherited when you start a toplevel shell.

\section{Viewer}
This is the first window you get when you start OCamlBrowser.
It displays a search window, and the list of modules in the load path.
At the top a row of menus.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf File - Open} and {\bf File - Editor} give access to the
  editor.

\item {\bf File - Shell} creates an OCaml subprocess in a shell.

\item {\bf View - Show all defs} displays the signature of the currently
  selected module.

\item {\bf View - Search entry} shows/hides the search entry just
  below the menu bar.

\item {\bf Modules - Path editor} changes the load path.  {\bf Modules
    - Reset cache} rescans the load path and resets the module cache.
  Do it if you recompile some interface, or get confused about what is
  in the cache.

\item {\bf Modules - Search symbol} allows searching a symbol either
  by its name, like the bottom line of the viewer, or more
  interestingly, by its type. {\bf Exact type} searches for a type
  with exactly the same information as the pattern (variables match
  only variables). {\bf Included type} allows giving only partial
  information: the actual type may take more arguments and return more
  results, and variables in the pattern match anything. In both cases,
  argument and tuple order is irrelevant\footnote{To avoid
    combinatorial explosion of the search space, optional arguments in
    the actual type are ignored in the actual if (1) there are too many
    of them, and (2) they do not appear explicitly in the pattern.},
  and unlabeled arguments in the pattern match any label.

\item The {\bf Search entry} just below the menu bar allows one to
  search for an identifier in all modules (wildcards ``?'' and ``*''
  allowed). If you choose the "type" option, the search is done by type
  inclusion ({\em cf.} Search Symbol - Included type).

\item The {\bf Close all} button is there to dismiss the windows
  created by the Detach button.
  By double-clicking on it you will quit the browser.

\end{itemize}

\section{Module browsing}

You select a module in the leftmost box by either clicking on it or
pressing return when it is selected. Fast access is available in all
boxes pressing the first few letter of the desired name.
Double-clicking / double-return displays the whole signature for the
module.

Defined identifiers inside the module are displayed in a box to the
right of the previous one. If you click on one, this will either
display its contents in another box (if this is a sub-module) or
display the signature for this identifier below.

Signatures are clickable. Double clicking with the left mouse
button on an identifier in a signature brings you to its signature.
A single click on the right button pops up a menu displaying the
type declaration for the selected identifier. Its title, when
selectable, also brings you to its signature.

At the bottom, a series of buttons, depending on the context.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Detach} copies the currently displayed signature in a new window,
  to keep it.
\item {\bf Impl} and {\bf Intf} bring you to the implementation or
  interface of the currently displayed signature, if it is available.
\end{itemize}

Control-S lets you search a string in the signature.

\section{File editor}
You can edit files with it, if you're not yet used to emacs. Otherwise
you can use it as a browser, making occasional corrections.

The {\bf Edit} menu contains commands for jump (C-g), search (C-s),
and sending the current phrase (or selection if some text is selected)
to a sub-shell (M-x). For this last option, you may choose the shell
via a dialog.

Essential functions are in the {\bf Compiler} menu.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Preferences} opens a dialog to set internals of the editor
  and type-checker.

\item  {\bf Lex} adds colors according to lexical categories.

\item {\bf Typecheck} verifies typing, and memorizes to let one see an
  expression's type by double-clicking on it. This is also valid for
  interfaces. If an error occurs, the part of the interface preceding
  the error is computed.

  After typechecking, pressing the right button pops up a menu that gives
  the type of the pointed expression and, where applicable, provides
  some links that can be followed.

\item {\bf Clear errors} dismisses type-checker error messages and warnings.

\item {\bf Signature} shows the signature of the current file
  (after type checking).
\end{itemize}

\section{Shell}
When you create a shell, a dialog is presented to you, letting you
choose which command you want to run, and the title of the shell (to
choose it in the Editor).

%You may change the default command by setting the "OCAML"
%environment variable.

The executed subshell is given the current load path.

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf File} use a source file or load a bytecode file.  You may
  also import the browser's path into the subprocess.
\item {\bf History} M-p and M-n browse up and down.
\item {\bf Signal} C-c interrupts, and you can also kill the subprocess.
\end{itemize}
